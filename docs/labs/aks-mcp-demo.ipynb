      "Based on the network configurations of the two AKS clusters (\"hub\" in \"FL_hieunhu_testhubfleet1_eastasia\" and \"akskeda-aks\" in \"akskeda-rg\"), here is the detailed information and some recommendations for improvement:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Network Configuration Details:\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Cluster: \"hub\"\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Load Balancer**:\n",
      "   - **Backend Address Pools**: Utilizes two backend pools for outbound and cluster services.\n",
      "   - **Frontend IP Configurations**: Configured with a dynamic IP allocation and a standard public IP.\n",
      "   - **Outbound Rules**: Configured with an outbound rule enabling outbound traffic with TCP reset and specific idle timeout.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Network Security Group (NSG)**:\n",
      "   - **Default Security Rules**: Includes standard rules allowing VNet traffic, Azure Load Balancer traffic, and denying all inbound/outbound traffic except for Internet outbound.\n",
      "   - **Custom Rules**: No additional custom rules found.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Virtual Network (VNet) and Subnet**:\n",
      "   - **VNet**: Configured with an address space of `10.224.0.0/12`.\n",
      "   - **Subnet**: Configured with a subnet `aks-subnet` with an address prefix of `10.224.0.0/16`. The subnet is associated with the appropriate NSG and contains multiple IP configurations.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Cluster: \"akskeda-aks\"\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Load Balancer**:\n",
      "   - **Backend Address Pools**: Utilizes backend pools for balancing various backend IP configurations.\n",
      "   - **Frontend IP Configurations**: Configured with dynamic IP allocation and public IP addresses.\n",
      "   - **Inbound Rules**: Several load balancing rules for ports 80, 443, 7473, 7474, and 7687. Probes configured for health checks.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Network Security Group (NSG)**:\n",
      "   - **Default Security Rules**: Includes standard rules similar to the \"hub\" cluster.\n",
      "   - **Custom Rules**: Custom rules to allow specific inbound traffic from the Internet to the load balancer and respective ports.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Virtual Network (VNet) and Subnet**:\n",
      "   - **VNet**: Configured with an address space of `10.224.0.0/12`.\n",
      "   - **Subnets**: Includes subnets `aks-subnet` and `aks-apiserver-subnet`, both associated with appropriate NSGs and link services.\n",
      "   - **NAT Gateway**: Configured in `aks-subnet` for outbound connectivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations for Improvement:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Enable Network Policies**:\n",
      "   - Implement network policies to control traffic flow between pods and services within the cluster. This can enhance security by ensuring that only authorized traffic is allowed.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **IP Ranges for API Server Access**:\n",
      "   - Define `authorizedIpRanges` in the `apiServerAccessProfile` to restrict access to the API Server, ensuring that only trusted IP addresses can reach the Kubernetes API.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Utilize Private Endpoints**:\n",
      "   - Consider configuring private endpoints for your API Server and other critical services. This can limit exposure to the public internet and enhance the security of your cluster.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Dedicated Route Table**:\n",
      "   - Implement a dedicated route table with specific routing rules to manage traffic flows within the VNet more effectively. This can be beneficial if you plan to use advanced networking features or integrate with other Azure services.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Review NSG Rules**:\n",
